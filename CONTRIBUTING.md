The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to NReplacer. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/teplostanski/nreplacer/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/teplostanski/nreplacer/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the unexpected behavior.

### Suggesting Enhancements

* Open a new issue with a clear title and description and provide as much relevant information as possible.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the NReplacer repository.
2. Create a new branch for your features or bugfixes.
3. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Use Git's [interactive rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.
4. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch.
5. Submit a pull request to the main branch. Include a clear description of your changes.
6. After feedback has been given, we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### TypeScript Styleguide

* All code must adhere to the [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) configuration provided.
* Document new code based on the README description.
* Include tests for any new features or bug fixes.
